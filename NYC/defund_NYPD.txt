Dear New York City Council Members,

My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [BOROUGH]. Last April, NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio proposed major budget cuts for the Fiscal Year 2021, especially to education and youth programs, while refusing to slash the NYPD budget by any significant margin.

I am emailing today to demand that you vote no on the Mayorâ€™s FY21 proposed budget. Furthermore, I urge you to pressure the office of the mayor towards an ethical and equal reallocation of the NYC expense budget, away from NYPD and towards social services and education programs, effective at the beginning of FY21, July 1, 2020.

Governor Cuomo has doubled the presence of the NYPD on New York City streets. I am asking that city officials lobby the same amount of attention and effort towards finding sustainable, longterm change.

Thank you, [YOUR NAME] [YOUR ADDRESS] [YOUR EMAIL] [YOUR PHONE NUMBER]
